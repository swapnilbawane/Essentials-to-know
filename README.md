# Essentials-to-know

## This is about Markdown
- You can make an unordered list by preceding one or more lines of text with - or *.
- To create a heading, add one to six # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the size of the heading.
- You can create fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks ``` before and after the code block. We recommend placing a blank line before and after code blocks to make the raw formatting easier to read.
- You can quote text with a >.
- You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ). You can also use the keyboard shortcut command + k to create a link. When you have text selected, you can paste a URL from your clipboard to automatically create a link from the selection. [ abc ] ( link_address ) - this without spaces. 

Below is a list
